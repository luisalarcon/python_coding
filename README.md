In this repository I will upload small python programs from the book "The self-taught programmer" by Cory Althoff.
  This is to practice version control
  To track my progress
  and for fun
 
I decided to read this book to supplement my Computer Science degree. I feel like my classes are not teaching enough practicality but that is the way university is structured. 
Anywyas, this book is the opposite of that system and I hope to come out on the other side a better programmer.
